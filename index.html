		<p id="inputText">Soundwaves that are received are intially seperated by frequency in the inner ear. These frequencies are mappedalong the basilar membrane in our cochlea. These frequencies are converted as activity in the cochlear nerve fibers, which terminate in the cochlear nuclear complex in the brain.</p>

		<p id="brainText">Neurons fire to send auditory signals to the inferior colliculus in the midbrain and the medial geniculate nucleus in the thalamus. These regions then send information to the auditory cortex.</p>

		<p id="brocaText">Information relating to speech takes a unique path, being projected into areas that are unique to human brains. The information can be sent to Broca's Area, Wernickes Area, or the inferior parietal and angular gyrus of the parietal lobe.</p>

		<h1 id="languageH">Understanding parts of language</h1>
		<p id="languageText">To be able to understand and interpret a sentence, the brain must be able to distinguish the speech into distinct parts. After having identified speech sounds from non-speech sounds, the brain must be able to understand the semantics and syntax of the speech. The semantics of a word refers to its meaning, while the syntax of a sentence involves the combining of individual words into a unquie sentence.</p>
		<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/dYORjPasFFpo4" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen id="talkingGif"></iframe>
		<p id="languageW">There are different theories for how semantic and syntactic processing is integrated. The anterior and posterior part of Wernickes area in the superior temporal gyrus are involved in processing syntax. The posterior portion of Wernicke's area is involved in processing semantic information, as well as integrating speech, motion, and facial processing, which is why it is easier to understand someone when looking at them rather than just listening.</p>

		<ul>
		<li id=coneptualization>
			Conceptualization is the first process of creating speech. The intention to produce speech links a concept to the specific words that a person wants to express. 
		</li>
		<br>
		<li id=formulation>
			Formulation is the second stage of language production. Formulation requires grammatical, phonetic, and morphological encoding. This is how the proper syntax is chosen, words are broken down into syllabus to be produced to speech, and producing the actual articulatory gestures in order to create audible articulation as the parts of the word are pieced together.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li id=articulation>
			Ariculation is the final stage of producing language. This is when physical parts such as the lungs, tongue, lips, jaw, and larynx are all used in collaboration, resulting in spoken, understandable speech. </li>
